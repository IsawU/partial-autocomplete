# Partial Autocomplete

This extension adds the ability to auto-complete by incremental steps. (Think bash auto-completion.)

## Troubleshooting

- My suggestions are not detected by Partial Autocomplete
    - See extension settings. Some languages (for example Lua) use `CompletionItemKind.Text` (plain text) for suggestions. `Text` suggestions are ignored with the default settings.
